                <p>My Name is Luke Hawley and I am a research programmer and data scientist who lives in New Orleans.</p>
                <p>I studied Mechanical Engineering and Planetary science at the University of Arizona and I was lucky to work as an undergraduate researcher and later as a systems programmer on the OSIRIS-REx mission. While there I created tools for mission scientists in Matlab and C++ and learned what it means to be a part of a development team. </p>
                <p>Currently I'm working throught MIT Datascience Micromasters and cementing my skills in python, machine learning and statistics.</p>
                <p>I have a wide variety of technical skills and a passion for learning and doing. If you are interested in employing me, you can reach me at the email posted below. </p>
